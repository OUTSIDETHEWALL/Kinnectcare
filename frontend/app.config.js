/**
 * Kinnship — Expo dynamic app config (v1.2.0+).
 *
 * Converted from `app.json` to `app.config.js` in the Transistor location
 * engine migration so we can inject the
 * `react-native-background-geolocation` Android + iOS license keys at
 * build time from `process.env` without ever committing the JWT strings
 * to Git.
 *
 * Local dev / `npx expo run:android`:
 *   • Keys are loaded from `/app/frontend/.env` (gitignored, mode 600).
 *
 * EAS cloud builds (`eas build`):
 *   • Keys are loaded from EAS Secrets uploaded once via
 *     `eas secret:create TRANSISTOR_LICENSE_ANDROID --type string ...`.
 *   • Expo's build infrastructure injects them as env vars before this
 *     file is evaluated.
 *
 * Everything else is byte-for-byte preserved from the prior `app.json`
 * to keep OTA channels, runtime versions, and EAS pipelines stable
 * during the migration.

      versionCode: 59, // Build 59 — CLOSED BETA READINESS. (P1) FAMILY INVITATION FLOW REWRITE: `add-member.tsx` is now an invitation form (Name / Email / Relationship / Family or Senior). One button — "Send Invitation" — creates the invite backend-side, delivers a senior-friendly email with big "Accept Invitation" deep-link button (kinnship://invite/{token}) + Play Store fallback (KINNSHIP_PLAY_STORE_URL env var). New deep-link route `app/invite/[token].tsx` handles one-tap acceptance for both logged-in and logged-out users. (P2) OTP DELIVERY RELIABILITY: `/auth/request-otp` now records delivery status back to Mongo; new `/auth/otp-status?email=X` polling endpoint so the client can show a real error banner if Resend fails instead of a silent inbox. (P3) LOCATION-SHARING CROSS-CONTAMINATION FIX: PUT /me/preferences now matches on `user_id` ONLY (previously $or with owner_id, which wiped rows the caregiver had created for OTHER people — the Charles→Joyce bug). One-time heal migration `_heal_cross_user_sharing_leaks` restores rows that were incorrectly turned off. (P4) STRICTER BLANK-PUSH VALIDATOR in expo_push.py: any visible push must have BOTH title AND body ≥3 chars; placeholder titles like "Update"/"K" are rejected. (P5) STRIPE LIVE-REFRESH FALLBACK for renewal date — if the stored current_period_end is missing or stale, we fetch fresh from Stripe.Subscription.retrieve so "Renews on…" always shows the correct date even when the webhook is misconfigured. (P6) MEDICATION CHIP hidden when 0/0 (no schedule). (P7) IMMEDIATE DASHBOARD REFRESH on member delete via new `memberStore.remove()`. (P8) PENDING INVITE STRIP on dashboard. (P10) CUSTOM SVG KINNSHIP TAB ICONS via new `KinnshipTabIcon` component — shared shield outer frame + per-tab inner glyph (three-people / person / bell) rendered with react-native-svg so geometry is identical iOS/Android; active = Kinnship green #1B5E35, inactive = muted brand grey-green #8FA697. (P11) PENDING INVITE BADGE ("🟡 Invitation Pending") on dashboard cards until accepted.
